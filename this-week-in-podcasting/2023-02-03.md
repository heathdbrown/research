> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiokTYzA6BI

* be careful with ChatGPT as it does not recoginize what 'accurate' actually means
* Treat it as a reference manual, narrow your scope for answers, and verify the answer
* Especially, with code.
* StackOverflow has banned ChatGPT answers, as how ChatGPT answers sounds assertative and authoritative.
* ChatGPT does NOT learn, it is a pre-trained language model
