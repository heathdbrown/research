From a networking perspective, Dijkstra's Algorithm is an idea we hear about often, how Dijkstra's Algorithm is used as the basis for open shortest path first (OSPF) routing protocol and spanning tree protocol (STP).

Generally, I would assume that we would not encounter needing to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm in our own code base, except in a few cases.

For me, one of those being Advent of Code.
