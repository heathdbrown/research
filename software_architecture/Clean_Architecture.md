# Overview

Uncle Bob put together several different architectures in different paradigms into one reference in a blog post in 2012, 'Clean Architecture'.

This goes into breaking down an application into different parts and using several design patterns to help remove coupling between layers through the use of abstractions.

The links in References are different online resources I have found helpful in understanding and relate it to Python.
